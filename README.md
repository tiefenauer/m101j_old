# m101j
This repository contains the source code for the course ["MongoDB for Java Developers"](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/M101J/about) from MongoUniversity as well as my solutions for the homework assignments. I created the code by coding along to the tutorial videos, so there may be slight differences to what's shown in the video. There are branches called `week01`, `week02`, `week02`, ... and so on that contain the code for each week (code and homework solutions). 

The code from the course is in a folder called `course`, the solutions for the homework is in a folder called `homework`. The code was created using [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and can be imported there.

**Important:**
The solutions for the homework assignments are here only for your reference. Don't just copy the code to solve the assignments, or you won't learn anything!
